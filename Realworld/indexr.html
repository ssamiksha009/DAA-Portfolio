            <p class="video-description">This project introduces an innovative utilization of the Convex Hull algorithm to precisely delineate
                tumor boundaries using provided tumor coordinates. The Convex Hull algorithm constructs the
                smallest convex shape encompassing these points, facilitating accurate mapping of tumor spatial
                distribution within the body. By leveraging the computational efficiency and robustness of the
                Convex Hull algorithm, the project significantly enhances medical diagnosis and treatment planning.
                This approach offers healthcare professionals valuable insights into tumor localization and
                distribution, aiding in more informed decision-making. Moreover, the adoption of Convex Hull in this
                project underscores its potential for advancing medical imaging and diagnostic practices. By
                providing a precise method for tumor boundary delineation, the project lays the foundation for more
                effective interventions and personalized treatment strategies. This innovative application of Convex
                Hull not only enhances patient care but also paves the way for further advancements in medical data
                analysis and healthcare outcomes.
